- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pedrohdemarchi
- 👀 Passionate about games, technology and programming.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying some PHP laravel. But as my focus is the front end, I'm more involved in javascript and vueJs applying this knowledge in the EJ that I'm inserted.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in the construction together with the other interns of adapti's new website.
- 📫 You can find me at this contact address: pedro.marchi@edu.ufes.br
